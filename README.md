## üöÄ What is QuantaraX?

QuantaraX is a lightweight, browser-based MVP for retail investors, built by quants and former traders, that:

- **Demystifies technical analysis** by blending Moving Average, RSI, and MACD signals into one clear ‚ÄúBUY / HOLD / SELL‚Äù recommendation.  
- **Backtests** strategies over 6 months of historical data with performance stats and equity curves.  
- **Runs batch comparisons** across multiple tickers.  
- **Simulates portfolios**, letting you input your own positions and see profit/loss, allocation pie charts, and suggestions.  
- **Surfaces live price and sentiment-weighted news** via VADER.  
- **Serves as a Progressive Web App (PWA)** for mobile ‚Äúinstall‚Äù and offline caching.

This repo contains the full Streamlit app source code and all assets needed to run locally, on Streamlit Cloud, or as a PWA.
